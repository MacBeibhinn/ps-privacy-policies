    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires certain device permissions to provide core launcher functionality, including organizing the home screen, displaying widgets, showing notification dots, and listing installed apps. These permissions are used solely for these core features and do not result in any data collection, transmission, or sharing.</p>

    <p>The following permissions may be requested:</p>
    
        <p>• Query Installed Apps (QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES): Required to display a list of installed apps. This data is only used to populate the app drawer(s) and any home page favorites/shortcuts, and to provide the user with a list of installed applications. This data is not used for any other purpose.</p>

        <p>• Chosen app shortcuts (or favorites) and their positions on the home screen.</p>
    
        <p>• Selected widgets and their placement.</p>
    
        <p>• Any custom settings applied within the launcher, such as grid size, themes, text or clock settings, icon packs, etc.</p>
