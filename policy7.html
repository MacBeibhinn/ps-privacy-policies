    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: March 5, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us, the developer(s) of Runic Launcher. This Privacy Policy governs any collection, use, and sharing of personal information by the developer(s) and Runic Launcher (also RLauncher, and Runic Launcher - Home Page), an Android application/software (here also referred to as; 'our app', or 'the app'). By using our app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not log or store any personal data or information. If you contact us via our support email (macbeibhinn@mail.scot), any information you may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your case. No personal data or information is collected, any personal data voluntarily sent to our support email is deleted immediately.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We may retain any information collected for as long as necessary to provide support, our services, or as required by law. We will delete any collected information upon request or when it is no longer needed.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or rent any personal or collected information to third parties. Any data accessed is not stored or transmitted to third parties, in some cases where there is a crash or issue with the app we may log the relevant code to help improve our services. However, if possible, we may disclose any collected information in response to legal process or a request from a law enforcement agency or regulatory authority.</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>While we do not store personal or collected data, we take reasonable measures to ensure that any data processed is handled securely. However, no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of any information.</p>

    <p>We do not log, store, or share any links or apps accessed by users. By using our app, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the links or apps you enter, store, or access through the app. We do not endorse or take responsibility for the content of any third-party websites or apps that may be accessed through the launcher.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    The app requires certain device permissions to provide core launcher functionality, including organizing the home screen, displaying widgets, showing notification dots, and listing installed apps. These permissions are used solely for these core features and do not result in any data collection, transmission, or sharing.

    The following permissions may be requested:
    
        • Query Installed Apps (QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES): Required to display a list of installed apps.
    
        • Bind App Widgets: Required to allow adding and managing widgets on the home screen.
    
        • Request Delete Packages (REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES): Required for requesting to delete or uninstall apps.
    
        • Set Wallpaper (SET_WALLPAPER): Required for choosing and setting the device wallpaper directly from the app
    
        • Notification Access (optional): Required to show notification dots (or badges), indicating app notifications. This access is used only to check the presence and count of notifications associated with each app, and this information is not stored or transmitted.
    
    All permissions are used exclusively on the device to enable the launcher’s features. No data accessed through these permissions is collected, stored externally, or shared with us or third parties.

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    The app stores certain preferences and configurations directly on the device to remember how the home screen is set up. This data includes:

        • Chosen app shortcuts (or favorites) and their positions on the home screen.
    
        • Selected widgets and their placement.
    
        • Any custom settings applied within the launcher, such as grid size, themes, text or clock settings, icon packs, etc.
    
    This data is stored locally on the device only and is never transmitted to external servers or shared with us or any third parties. Uninstalling the app will remove this locally stored data.
  
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage everyone to review this policy periodically for any updates. Continued use of our app after we make changes to this policy indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For any questions about this privacy policy or how we handle information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:macbeibhinn@mail.scot">macbeibhinn@mail.scot</a></p>
