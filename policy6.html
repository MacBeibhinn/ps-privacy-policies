    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 7, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us, the developer(s) of BookSafe. This Privacy Policy governs any collection, use, and sharing of personal information by the developer(s) and BookSafe (also BookSafe+, BS, and BookSafe - Bookmark Manager), an Android application/software (here also referred to as; 'our app', or 'the app').

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not log or store any personal data or information. If you contact us via our support email (macbeibhinn@mail.scot), any information you may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your case. No personal data or information is collected, any personal data voluntarily sent to our support email is deleted immediately.</p>

    <p>We do not share, sell, or rent any personal or collected information to third parties. Any data accessed is not stored or transmitted to third parties, in some cases where there is a crash or issue with the app we may log the relevant code to help improve our services. However, if possible, we may disclose any collected information in response to legal process or a request from a law enforcement agency or regulatory authority.</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>While we do not store personal or collected data, we take reasonable measures to ensure that any data processed is handled securely. However, no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of any information.</p>

    <h2>Title Generation, Links, Icons, and Sites</h2>
    <p>Our app allows users to enter or share a link with the app to generate and retrieve the title or icon of the link page. When you add, store, or share a link with the app, it locally saves the link (without sending, collecting, or sharing it with anyone else) and optionally generates a title or icon for that link.</p>

The presence of any external links in the application does not imply endorsement or approval of the linked site or its content.</p>
